# IPL-Data-Visualisation
Built an interactive Tableau Dashboard showcasing insights for the big Data set of Indian Premier League.
Combining the information in the IPL Datasets, I  had createfd an interactive dashboard that highlights some of the important statistics of IPL over the years -

1. Match Statistics

-Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)

-Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)

-Highest totals (across all the seasons)
 

2. Player Statistics

-Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)

-Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)

-Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)

3. Team Statistics

-Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)

-Win %age ( home vs away)
